    <h1>Fourth.</h1>
    <p class="month-subtitle">
        From navigating online learning during the pandemic to embracing leadership, 
        I could tell how much I grew over the past five (5) years. The journey map that I made 
        allowed me to stay grounded as I revisit my experiences and milestones. I never knew making 
        the journey map (Life in AdDU) would be a wholesome moment for me who is now a senior in college. 
        With that, this journal entry reflects on how AdDU has formed me, where I encountered God along my 
        journey, and how I am being called to continue my life journey moving forward.

          <h2>The Journey of Growth</h2>
          As I created my journey map, I realized how much I have grown beyond academics. 
          As a student who started my freshman year online, lost and unsure with the path I took, I did 
          not expect that I would find myself serving the ChE community with pride and passion. However, 
          my journey wasn’t linear as I had my shared rock-bottom moments from failed exams and overwhelming 
          pressure during leadership and academic work. Yet looking back, I was meant to experience those as 
          it contributed to who I am now. Overall, mapping my AdDU journey allowed me to acknowledge my 
          growth over the years and assured myself that I am meant to take this life path.

            <h2>A Holistic Educational Practice</h2>
            Studying in AdDU clearly tells about their holistic approach in honing their students, an 
            education that goes beyond technical competence. Despite the challenging program I took, AdDU 
            has taught me how to lead while upholding the Ignatian values; most importantly, serving others 
            with commitment. Through organizations like JPIChE and PIChE-JCM, I learned responsibility, 
            teamwork, and trust because leadership is not meant to be carried alone. Through academics, 
            I learned to practice discernment and acknowledging God in all things. Hence, AdDU has become 
            a huge part of shaping me as an individual.

            <h2>Everything Will Make Sense. Even If You Think It Doesn’t</h2>
           Honestly, I have only started to find God in my journey during my rock-bottom moments. 
           There have been a lot of times where I struggled balancing my academics and leadership 
           responsibilities. I failed some of my exams, I settled for mediocrity in my deliverables 
           in JPIChE. I lost my spark to live my life but through the company of my friends and loved 
           ones, I managed to love life again. They served as God’s instruments to remind me that I am 
           strong enough to face my hurdles in life and that everything will make sense in the end — I 
           just needed to acknowledge God’s presence and trust Him. From then, I am reminded that God was 
           present in my life all along.

            <h2>Navigate My Career with Humility</h2>
           My experiences in AdDU have called me to apply the holistic approach as I build my career. 
           I am called to lead with humility and perform my duties with commitment. I am called to treat 
           any discomfort and unfamiliarity in my work as an opportunity to grow while upholding the 
           Ignatian teachings. As I move forward, I am reminded to find God in all things as St. Ignatius 
           does.
