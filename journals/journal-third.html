    <h1>Third.</h1>
    <p class="month-subtitle">
        This journal reflects on the session last January 30, 2026 entitled Looking Beyond the Self. 
        We were divided into six (6) groups and we are to discuss how DIGNITY is applied or observed 
        in the university environment.

          <h2>Being Intentional with the Ignatian Values</h2>
          I have learned the most about the 7 values presented during the session. It has left a mark on 
          me until now as I realized how transactional my life in the university is that I forgot the 
          importance of practicing these values as we interact with people. As I look back, I may have 
          been unconsciously practicing some of the values but I realized how important it is to recognize 
          them and be intentional with becoming men and women for others as an atenean.

            <h2>A More Humane Life</h2>
            We had a group activity where we reflected on how the value of dignity is observed in our daily 
            lives in the university. This activity made me understand the theme, Looking beyond the Self, 
            as an opportunity to reflect on how we are as an AdDU student. Do we practice the Ignatian values 
            instilled in us in our university lives? The gist of our group’s reflection is that we 
            recognized dignity specifically in how we treat others. We respect everyone in the university, 
            the staff, faculty, and students, as they have dignity. We recognized their inherent worth as 
            a person; hence, we give a fair treatment to everyone. This realization helped me treat myself 
            with more compassion, especially during moments of pressure. Moreover, I grew more attentive to 
            the dignity of others, becoming less judgmental. Hence, as I uphold this value when interacting 
            with anyone in the university and with myself, I am living a life that is more humane.

</span>
            <h2>Practicing Gratitude Throughout Life</h2>
            Firstly, I am thankful to my family for their dedication in providing my financial and 
            material needs as I study at the Ateneo de Davao University. Secondly, my classmates and friends for the genuine connections I built with them along the way. Studying BS Chemical Engineering in a competitive university is such an overwhelming journey. With my friends, they never once let me feel that I am alone and they treated me with dignity and respect. I am also thankful to the professors I have encountered in my stay in AdDU as they have helped me improve my skills necessary for me to survive my college program. Lastly, I am thankful for my partner who has been with me through thick and thin. Her encouragement, kind words, and unwavering support made me feel safe and assured that this challenging journey will be worthwhile in the end. 
            As I move forward, I plan to deepen the value of gratitude by recognizing them throughout my life. 
            Maintaining our genuine connection through random check-ins or catch-ups signifies their importance 
            in my life. This value will help me grow as a person who leads with dignity and respect, and in society, 
            could contribute through collaboration and service.
