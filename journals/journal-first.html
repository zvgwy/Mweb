          <h2>Hello Thesis, Goodbye!</h2>
          After almost a year of working on our undergraduate thesis, we finally got our 
          hardbound and took photos in this iconic spot. I honestly didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d finish on time, 
          especially since I started writing chapters 4 and 5 just two weeks before defense week. But pushing 
          through the challenges made finishing it is totally worth it.

            <h2>Beautiful Flowers = Beautiful Day</h2>
            I really love giving flowers to my significant other. 
            May it be on a random day or on a special occasion, such as this day of the week. 
            I realized that one of my ways in expressing my love is through my dedication in choosing every 
            stem to include in my arrangement, making sure it looks beautiful (chose that flower arrangement in the 
            photo for about 25 minutes hehe). I cherish every moment as an opportunity to convey love through meaningful actions.

            <h2>Trying Something New</h2>
            I am not a matcha person but my friends wanted to try this matcha bar near 
            school called Kisom. (spoiler alert: I ordered coffee) As I entered the place, it was so 
            aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I still canâ€™t open my heart to matcha so I stuck to ordering coffee. 
            My friends let me taste their two kinds of matcha: Matcha latte and matcha volume 1. I donâ€™t find any distinct 
            difference in terms of their taste profile but I realized, matcha is not that bad at all. This may be a simple 
            moment but it reminded me that openness is more important than preference.

            <h2>Long-Due Catch Up Session</h2>
            I met these people way back in June 2019 during SHS. I thought it was just a random 
            lunch together because we found out we were from the same province, but little did I know that was the 
            start of a genuine friendship that would last up until today. Itâ€™s been 2 years since we last hung out. As we conversed, 
            a lot has changed. PL (middle) got her first job as an HR at a start-up company while Jared (right) and 
            I are thriving in our last year in college. I had a lot of fun reconnecting with my SHS constants.

            <h2>A Step Closer to Reality!</h2>
            This semester, we are required to take this course on mock boards 
            for us to be prepared for the upcoming Chemical Engineering Licensure Examination 
            in November 2026. Every week, we have a series of quizzes and discussions highlighting the 
            topics from 1st year to 4th year. Coming from a batch who underwent online class for their first 
            2 years in college, I realized how I lack skills on the fundamentals of engineering and chemistry. 
            I canâ€™t blame anyone or myself for it because that was a lot of adjustment for me. However, reality hits 
            that I need to keep up with this fast-paced semester by studying extra hard. Right now, I am still finding my 
            good study habits and peak study time. Maybe for now, it is best for me to pause and reflect as I navigate my path.
