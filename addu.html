        <p>The freshmen orientation program marked the beginning of my journey at the 
          Ateneo de Davao University. It was nice to meet new people and build connections with them 
          through my screen. Despite the pandemic, our facilitators, Ate Andi and Ate Mich, did not fail 
          to let us feel that we are welcome with their initiative for us to interact online. Also, Ate 
          Mich was a BS Chemical Engineering student, making my AFYOP days extra special and memorable. 
          This event reminded me that what truly scares me about stepping into a new environment is the 
          unfamiliarityâ€”but that fear fades when you are welcomed by the right people.

        <p>I never thought being a student leader was still my thing in college. I was planning 
          to be a lowkey student whose responsibility is to pass the courses each semester. I was 
          offered to become the Assistant Secretary General of our academic club, the Junior Philippine 
          Institute of Chemical Engineers (JPIChE), because they observed my passion and skills in leadership. 
          As an online freshie who was eager to try something new, I took the role. Through this role, I learnt 
          how to craft all kinds of paperworks in the organization. Now that I am a senior, this welcoming 
          ceremony of JPIChE holds a special place in my heart as this organization created a huge impact 
          in my college journey (you'll see why).

        <p>A freshie in a regional organization?! Yep, that’s me. 
          The president of Philippine Institute of Chemical Engineers - Junior 
          Chapter Mindanao (PIChE-JCM) during the 2021-2022 term was from AdDU and one of 
          my closest seniors. With his trust, he offered me to become his Vice President for 
          Communications, the one in charge of social media postings and announcements. 
          It was an honor to experience serving in a regional organization. I was 
          magis in every deliverable especially conducting online events was still 
          challenging to navigate back then. Nevertheless, I realized that this role was not for me.

        <p>Ending the academic year meant taking class photos. Since 2022 was long ago, 
          I retrieved this class photo we had for our Analytical Chemistry Lab. Itâ€™s a shame 
          to experience freshman year online as this could be an opportunity to create a strong 
          camaraderie with our classmates.

        <p>Sophomore year was when AdDU transitioned to limited face-to-face classes. 
          Since then, we conducted all assessments for major courses face-to-face. 
          This was the highlight moment of all on-campus exams I had as this was the 
          time I first met my classmates. We were at the gazebo area gathered to share 
          our mixed feelings about taking the test on Chemical Engineering Calculations 
          despite meeting for the first time, observing cura personalis towards each other. 
          Honestly, it wasnâ€™t a good first meet-up as we are all anxious for the test lol.

        <p>
          For the first time since the pandemic, the AdDU fiesta was held on-campus. 
          As a sophomore who hadn't experienced this activity before, I went with my 
          classmates. However, it was in the middle of the prelim season and we didn't know 
          we had an activity in Differential Equations to be submitted within the day. We 
          failed to submit the said activity and were shocked to know that a week after the 
          fiesta was already the departmental exam. Lesson learned: di pwede maglipay-lipay

        <p>
          I was the leader in organizing the annual tradition of JPIChE, team building. 
          As the current secretary general of the said organization, I had no difficulty 
          in doing the internal paperworks, from concept paper to venue and equipment 
          reservations. I was glad that my classmates were cooperative and participative 
          despite the results we got from our DE prelim exam (most of us did not pass 
          lol huhu I only got 26/80). By recognizing God amidst life challenges, we 
          were able to pull off a successful first on-campus JPIChE team building since the pandemic!

        <p>
          It was not until May 2024 when I accepted the role to become the 
          JPIChE President. I contemplated and gave myself some time to discern because 
          accepting this role meant a huge responsibility and a shift in my student life. 
          I will have to balance deliverables with my academics. I had a lot of what ifâ€™s 
          before I decided to step up. I did not think Iâ€™d get to this point where I am the 
          one to lead the ChE community. It was not long before I started joining orgs during 
          my freshie days huhu now weâ€™re here! I was committed to every meeting, event, and 
          initiative we had during my term. However, I had a lot of rock bottom moments during 
          my presidency. I sacrificed my nights to pave way for any meetings and deliverables 
          instead of working on my academics. It was during my term when I realized how 
          important it was to just trust your colleagues because they accepted their respective 
          roles for a reason. Officers are meant to work together.

          I went to Cebu to attend the national leadership summit of JPIChE 
          representing the AdDU Chapter. I went with my ChE Representative, 
          Jonyl De Los Reyes, which made the trip more memorable as I was 
          with someone I know. It was that time when I realized the benefits 
          of joining organizations, itâ€™s the connection you can build between 
          the delegates. It feels surreal to think that some of them are registered 
          chemical engineers right now!

          After that 1st Cebu trip, I went back after 3 months to attend the PIChE 
          National Convention to represent AdDU during the JPIChE Annual General Assembly. 
          This trip served as a team building between me and my moderator, which brought us 
          closer together where I can share my struggles as a president to her anytime 
          (huhu super thankful kay maam Beans). While in Cebu, I juggled the national 
          convention with prelim season so I had to study every break. It was a memorable

          As a graduating student, mock boards bring real pressure because they are a testament 
          to what I have learned over the years in college. As a student who took 1st and 2nd year 
          online, I had a hard time grasping the fundamentals of our program as they were taught remotely. 
          As we went through two tests so far, I realized that I should double up my work as time is limited. 
          Mock boards is tough, but they just show that Iâ€™m ready and one step closer to becoming the 
          professional Iâ€™ve been working so hard to be.
