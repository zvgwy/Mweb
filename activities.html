        <p>
          I entered college with a plan. Finish this 4-year course, graduate by June 2025, get a job, and live life. There is no problem with dreaming big because that’s how we go on with life, achieving our desires. However, there are times when life will humble you. It was December 2022 when I had a major setback in college which stopped me in my tracks, I failed a major course. My life was in a stall. How do I tell my parents? What about my plan? What now? These were the questions that were going through my mind that time.
          Over the months, I had a hard time accepting the fact that I am now an irregular student. I tend to get shy getting along with my new classmates (who are not my batchmates). However, even though I am an irregular student, I don’t feel left out. That was when I realized that maybe God is telling me something. God reminded me that control is an illusion and growth often comes through surrender. This experience taught me to stay grounded and to have humility to accept that not everything goes in my way. And through my inner freedom, I must learn how to pivot things.
          Life does not end with a single F grade. Don’t let anyone or anything stop you from dreaming 
          big no matter how turbulent life may be. Always remember, every delay is a redirection.
